Raderie is an app to figure out which human values such as creativity, humility, moderation, or sensitivity are more or less valuable to us, then compare that to our friends and loved ones.

This is currently a landing page for the Android Native, iOS Native, and Web versions which are in development.

The latest version can be found hosted at https://raderie.me
